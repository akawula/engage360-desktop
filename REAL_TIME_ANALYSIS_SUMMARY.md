# Real-Time Text Analysis System - Project Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the real-time text analysis system design for the Engage360 desktop application. The system will monitor note-writing in real-time and automatically identify potential action items using Ollama AI integration, providing immediate visual feedback through a sidebar panel with confidence scores and quick-create functionality.

## Key Requirements Addressed

✅ **Real-time Analysis**: As-you-type analysis with 300-500ms debounced API calls
✅ **Action Item Detection**: Imperative language, deadlines, task keywords, assignments, commitments
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Sidebar panel with detected items, confidence scores, and quick-create buttons
✅ **Multi-language Support**: Leveraging Ollama's capabilities for international text analysis
✅ **Performance**: Maintaining responsive typing experience while processing text
✅ **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing note creation and action item workflows

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Enhanced Ollama Service** (`src/services/enhancedOllamaService.ts`)
   - Extends existing Ollama integration with real-time capabilities
   - Implements caching, model warming, and performance optimizations
   - Provides fallback to regex patterns when AI unavailable

2. **Real-Time Analysis Service** (`src/services/realTimeAnalysisService.ts`)
   - Manages debounced text processing and analysis queuing
   - Coordinates between AI analysis and regex fallbacks
   - Handles incremental analysis for performance

3. **Action Item Sidebar** (`src/components/ActionItemSidebar.tsx`)
   - Displays detected action items grouped by confidence level
   - Provides quick-create buttons and batch operations
   - Shows confidence scores and priority indicators

4. **Enhanced Rich Text Editor** (modifications to `src/components/RichTextEditor.tsx`)
   - Integrates real-time analysis triggers
   - Displays analysis status and indicators
   - Maintains backward compatibility

5. **Text Analysis Engine** (`src/services/textAnalysisEngine.ts`)
   - Implements regex-based pattern detection as fallback
   - Provides confidence scoring algorithms
   - Handles date extraction and assignee detection

## Technical Specifications

### Data Models

```typescript
interface DetectedActionItem {
  id: string
  content: string
  type: ActionItemType
  priority: Priority
  confidence: number // 0-1
  suggestedTitle: string
  suggestedDescription?: string
  suggestedDueDate?: string
  suggestedAssignee?: string
  textPosition: TextPosition
  context: string
  detectionMethod: 'ai' | 'regex' | 'hybrid'
  metadata: ActionItemMetadata
}

interface AnalysisResult {
  detectedItems: DetectedActionItem[]
  analysisMetadata: AnalysisMetadata
  suggestions: AnalysisSuggestion[]
  performance: PerformanceData
}
```

### Detection Patterns

The system detects action items through multiple pattern categories:

- **Imperative Language**: "need to", "should", "must", "implement", "fix"
- **Temporal References**: "by Friday", "due tomorrow", "deadline", date patterns
- **Assignment Patterns**: "@username", "assign to", "responsible for"
- **Commitment Phrases**: "I will", "we'll", "promise to", "commit to"
- **Task Keywords**: "TODO", "FIXME", "ACTION", "TASK"

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

The confidence scoring system considers:

1. **Base Factors**: Pattern match strength, context relevance, language clarity
2. **Adjustment Factors**: Urgency keywords, date proximity, assignment clarity
3. **Penalty Factors**: Ambiguous language, negation patterns, conditional statements

Final scores are normalized to 0-1 range with configurable thresholds.

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Text-based Caching**: Hash-based cache keys for text segments
- **LRU Cache**: Configurable size limits with automatic cleanup
- **Model Warming**: Pre-load Ollama models on application start

### Processing Optimizations
- **Debounced Analysis**: 300-500ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
- **Incremental Processing**: Only analyze changed text sections
- **Background Queuing**: Queue management for multiple analysis requests

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback to regex when Ollama unavailable
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear indicators of analysis status and errors
